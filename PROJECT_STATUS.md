# Telegram API Service - Project Status

## Clean Implementation Summary

This project has been refactored to remove ALL mock functionality and implement only real Telegram MTProto API operations using the telegram (gramjs) library.

## What's Included

### API Endpoints (Only Real Operations)
1. `/api/validate-session` - Validates Telegram session and returns user info
2. `/api/get-similar-channels` - Gets similar/recommended channels using real API

### Core Structure
```

├── telegramService.ts           # Main service aggregating all operations
└── types.ts                     # TypeScript interfaces
```

## What Was Removed
- ❌ All mock/placeholder functionality
- ❌ Gift sending/receiving endpoints (not available in standard API)
- ❌ Balance checking endpoints (not available in standard API)
- ❌ Test files with placeholder data
- ❌ Unused interfaces for removed operations

## Real Operations Available

The TelegramService provides access to real Telegram API operations:

- **User**: validateSession, getUsers, getUserPhotos, updateProfile, getBlockedUsers
- **Channel**: getSimilarChannels, getChannelInfo, getChannelParticipants, searchChannels, join/leave
- **Message**: send/get/delete/edit messages, forward, pin, mark as read
- **Media**: send photo/video/document/voice, download media, manage chat photos
- **Chat**: get dialogs, create groups, archive, mute, clear history
- **Payment**: premium gift codes, payment forms, receipts, giveaways

## TypeScript Notes

Some TypeScript errors remain due to the telegram library's complex type definitions, particularly around:
- BigInt vs BigInteger types
- Union types for different Telegram entities
- Missing or incorrect property definitions in the library

These don't affect runtime functionality but may require type assertions in some places.

## Usage

```typescript
const telegram = new TelegramService({
  apiId: 12345,
  apiHash: 'your-api-hash',
  sessionString: 'your-session-string',
  userId: 'user-id'
});

// All operations use real Telegram API
const session = await telegram.validateSession();
const channels = await telegram.channel.getSimilarChannels('@channel', 10);
```

## Status: ✅ CLEAN

All mock functionality has been removed. Only real Telegram API operations remain.
